        <p>
         We say that <m>f(c)</m> is a <term>relative maximum</term> (or local maximum) of <m>f</m> provided that <m>f(c)\geq f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> near <m>c</m>. We say that <m>f(c)</m> is a <term>relative minimum</term> (or local minimum) of <m>f</m> provided that <m>f(c)\leq f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> near <m>c</m>.

    <observation>
<p> 
A strategy for finding the extreme values of a function on open intervals will be to consider all the relative maxima and minima and compare them to find which one(s) give the largest and smallest values. But now we have a new problem: how do you find the relative extrema?  We can detect relative extrema by computing the first derivative and finding the critical points (or critical numbers) of the function. By finding the critical points, we will produce a list of candidates for the extrema (local and global) of the function.
