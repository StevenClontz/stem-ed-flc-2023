    <p permid="Kqf">
      In <xref ref="integration-riemann-1"/>, we established that whenever <m>v</m> is constant on an interval,
      the exact distance traveled is the area under the velocity curve.
      When <m>v</m> is not constant,
      we can estimate the total distance traveled by finding the areas of rectangles that approximate the area under the velocity curve.
    </p>

    <p permid="qxo">
      Thus, we see that finding the area between a curve and the horizontal axis is an important exercise:
      besides being an interesting geometric question,
      if the curve gives the velocity of a moving object,
      the area under the curve tells us the exact distance traveled on an interval.
      We can estimate this area if we have a graph or a table of values for the velocity function.
    </p>

    <p permid="WEx">
      In <xref ref="act-4-1-1"/>,
      we encountered an alternate approach to finding the distance traveled.
      If <m>y = v(t)</m> is a formula for the instantaneous velocity
      of a moving object,
      then <m>v</m> must be the derivative of the object's position function,
      <m>s</m>.
      If we can find a formula for <m>s(t)</m> from the formula for <m>v(t)</m>,
      we will know the position of the object at time <m>t</m>,
      and the change in position over a particular time interval tells us the distance traveled on that interval.
    </p>

    <p permid="CLG">
      For example, let's 
      consider the situation from <xref ref="integration-riemann-1"/>,
      where a person is walking along a straight line with velocity function <m>v(t) = 3</m> mph.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-4-1-PA1Soln" permid="Hvz">
      <caption>The velocity function <m>v(t) = 3</m> and corresponding position function <m>s(t) = 3t</m>.</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="4_1_PA1Soln" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="iSP">
      On the left-hand graph of the velocity function in <xref ref="F-4-1-PA1Soln">Figure</xref>,
      we see the relationship between area and distance traveled,
      <me permid="aiX">
        A= 3 \, \frac{\text{miles} }{\text{hour} } \cdot 1.25 \, \text{hours}  = 3.75 \, \text{miles}
      </me>.
      In addition, we observe<fn>
      Here we are making the implicit assumption that <m>s(0) = 0</m>.
      </fn> that if <m>s(t) = 3t</m>,
      then <m>s'(t) = 3</m>, 
      so <m>s(t) = 3t</m> is the position function whose derivative is the given velocity function,
      <m>v(t) = 3</m>.
      The respective locations of the person at times
      <m>t = 0.25</m> and <m>t = 1.5</m> are
      <m>s(1.5) = 4.5</m> and <m>s(0.25) = 0.75</m>, and therefore
      <me permid="Gqg">
        s(1.5) - s(0.25) = 4.5 - 0.75 = 3.75 \ \text{miles}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OZY">
      This is the person's change in position on <m>[0.25,1.5]</m>,
      which is precisely the distance traveled.
      
    </p>

    <p permid="vhh">
     Observe that if we know a formula for a velocity function <m>v</m>,
      it can be very helpful to find a function <m>s</m> that satisfies <m>s' = v</m>.
      We say that <m>s</m> is an
      <em>antiderivative</em> of <m>v</m>.
      More generally, we have the following formal definition.

      For example, if <m>g(x) = 3x^2 + 2x</m>,
      <m>G(x) = x^3 + x^2</m> is an antiderivative of <m>g</m>,
      because <m>G'(x) = g(x)</m>.
      Note that we say <q>an</q>
      antiderivative of <m>g</m> rather than <q>the</q>
      antiderivative of <m>g</m>, because
      <m>H(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 5</m> is also a function whose derivative is <m>g</m>,

    <p permid="PRj">
      The general problem of finding an antiderivative is difficult.
      In part, this is due to the fact that we are trying to undo the process of differentiating,
      and the undoing is much more difficult than the doing. However, some antiderivatives can be fairly simple to find if we remember our elementary derivative rules. (See <xref ref="DF3"/>.)</p>

      What is involved in trying to find an antiderivative for each?
      From our experience with derivative rules,
      we know that derivatives of sums and constant multiples of basic functions are simple to execute, but
      derivatives involving products, quotients,
      and composites of familiar functions are more complicated.
      Therefore, it stands to reason that antidifferentiating products,
      quotients,
      and composites of basic functions may be even more challenging.
      We defer our study of all but the most elementary antiderivatives to later in the text.

    <p permid="cfB">
      We now note that whenever we know the derivative of a function,
      we have a <em>function-derivative pair</em>,
      so we also know the antiderivative of a function.
      For instance, in <xref ref="elem-antider-intro"/> we could use our prior knowledge that 
      <me permid="YfC">
        \frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x)
      </me>,
     to determine that <m>F(x) = \sin(x)</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f(x) = \cos(x)</m>.
      <m>F</m> and <m>f</m> together form a function-derivative pair.
      Every elementary derivative rule leads us to such a pair,
      and thus to a known antiderivative.

      Notice that in <xref ref = "def-antiderivative"/> and <xref ref = "act-4-4-2"/> that we were asked to find <strong>an</strong> antiderivative, not <strong>the</strong> antiderivative.

      we may add a constant of our choice to 
      any antiderivative.
      For instance, we know that
