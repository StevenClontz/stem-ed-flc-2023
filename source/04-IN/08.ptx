  <introduction>
      <p> In <xref ref="IN7"/>, we learned how to find the area between a curve and the <m>x</m>-axis (<m>f(x)=0</m>) using a definite integral. What if we want the area between any two functions? What if the <m>x</m>-axis is not one of the boundaries?</p>
       
       <p>In this section, we'll investigate how a definite integral may be used to represent the area between two curves.</p>

    <p> We've seen from <xref ref="act-area-concept"/> that a natural way to think about the area between two curve is as the area beneath the upper curve minus the area beneath the lower curve.</p>

 <p permid="xlp">
      We can also think of the area this way:
      if we slice up the region between two curves into thin vertical rectangles,
      we see (as shown in <xref ref="area-as-slices"/>) that the height of a typical rectangle is given by the difference between the two functions,
      <m>f(x) - g(x)</m>,
      and its width is <m>\Delta x</m>.
      Thus the area of the rectangle is
      <me permid="cnf">
        A_{\text{rect} } = (f(x) - g(x)) \Delta x
      </me>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="area-as-slices" permid="icr">
      <caption>The area bounded by the functions <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>.</caption>
      <image width="75%" source="area-slices.png" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="dsy">
      The area between the two curves on <m>[a,b]</m> is thus approximated by the Riemann sum
      <me permid="Iuo">
        A \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} (f(x_i) - g(x_i)) \Delta x
      </me>,
      and as we let <m>n \to \infty</m>,
      it follows that the area is given by the single definite integral
      <me>
        A = \int_a^b (f(x) - g(x)) \, dx
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="JzH">
      In many applications of the definite integral,
      we will find it helpful to think of a
      <q>representative slice</q>
      and use the definite integral to add these slices.
      Here, the integral sums the areas of thin rectangles.
    </p>

    <p permid="pGQ">
      Finally, it doesn't matter whether we think of the area between two curves as the difference between the area bounded by the individual curves
      (as in<nbsp /><xref ref="act-area-concept2" />)
      or as the limit of a Riemann sum of the areas of thin rectangles between the curves
      (as in<nbsp /><xref ref="area-as-slices" />).
      These two results are the same,
      since the difference of two integrals is the integral of the difference:
      <me permid="UIG">
        \int_a^b f(x) \, dx -  \int_a^b g(x) \, dx = \int_a^b (f(x) - g(x)) \, dx
      </me>.

      Our work so far in this section illustrates the following general principle.

    <assemblage permid="LKt">
      <p permid="BVi">
        If two curves <m>y = f(x)</m> and
        <m>y = g(x)</m> intersect at <m>(a,g(a))</m> and <m>(b,g(b))</m>,
        and for all <m>x</m> such that
        <m>a \le x \le b</m>, <m>f(x) \ge g(x)</m>,
        then the area between the curves is <m>A = \int_a^b (f(x) - g(x)) \, dx</m>.
